# Grey's Anatomy Episode Recommender
The medical drama, Greyâ€™s Anatomy, is on its 18th season and will reach its 400th episode by its conclusion in May of this year. The show has maintained a wide fanbase and remains a top show on Netflix, with viewers watching older seasons as well as newer. As a fan myself, I assume a sizable share of fans rewatch favorite episodes, or even the entire series more than once. Before streaming services took over, sometimes shows would release DVD sets of select episodes (e.g. holiday episodes). In this spirit, I created a recommender based on episode topic to help fans find groups of similar episodes. I use natural language processing, topic modeling, and cosine similarity to produce this episode recommender and deploy it as a web app on Streamlit.
